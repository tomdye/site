Here&#8217;s a laundry list of some of the code checkins and QA fixes:</p>\\n<p>* Moxie had an encoding bug related to new lines being incorrectly serialized during the Dojo Offline syncing process &#8212; fixed<br />\\n* Polipo, our local proxy, was modified so that if it is online and a network error occurs, either from DNS, talking to a server, etc., we automatically &#8216;fault&#8217;, move offline, and attempt to replay the request against our local cache.<br />\\n* Sometimes, while loading the Moxie page using the local proxy while online with the browser cache cleared, it can take a LONG time or the browser can hang &#8212; Fixed, turned out to be related to how we were handling network timeouts<br />\\n* Create automated build system for Mac OS X and Windows &#8212; now, we can quickly push out Mac OS X and Windows builds with a single build command, issued on the Mac<br />\\n* On Safari, we don&#8217;t consistently get Moxie from the offline cache even if it is there &#8211; Fixed<br />\\n* Windows/Firefox: Go off the network, start up DOT, open browser, go to Moxie &#8212; &#8220;Falling back to using system resolver&#8221; &#8211; Fixed<br />\\n* Got the GNU Debugger (gdb) working on Windows, so we can quickly create Windows builds on the Mac and then debug Windows-specific bugs on Windows<br />\\n* On Safari: &#8220;Safari: Connect to codinginparadise.org:80 failed: Host is down&#8221; &#8211; Fixed with more generic solution to how we handle network errors, noted above<br />\\n* &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t send DNS query: Socket is not connected&#8221; &#8211; Fixed with more generic solution to how we handle network errors, noted above<br />\\n* Firefox/Mac OS X &#8212; go on network, start proxy, go to moxie, clear browser cache, close browser, drop off network, double click moxie link on desktop &#8212; browser just sits and spins &#8211; Fixed<br />\\n* On Safari, off the network, get the following when double clicking link from desktop &#8212; only sometimes: DNS: couldn&#8217;t open /etc/resolv.conf: No such file or directory &#8211; Fixed</p>\\n<h2>This Week</h2>\\n<p>The big task this week is to keep driving QA against the local proxy to improve reliability. Lots of the bug fixes above were basically of this type; we are testing the local proxy against Safari, Firefox, and IE on Windows and Mac OS X.</p>\\n<p>One example is to fix a caching edge case between the browser and the local proxy. Basically, sometimes we want to &#8216;bust&#8217; the browser cache to really talk to the local proxy, without busting the local proxy cache. This fixes a bug that can occur under some conditions.</p>\\n<p>Along side this, we want to get &#8216;automatic restart&#8217; code going for the local proxy. The local proxy will start on system startup &#8212; if it crashes for some reason, we want it to automatically restart.</p>\\n<p>This week I&#8217;d like to also hit other fit and finish issues, as well as potentially start putting together installers.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Last Week Last week we did lots and lots of coding on the local proxy for Dojo Offline.
