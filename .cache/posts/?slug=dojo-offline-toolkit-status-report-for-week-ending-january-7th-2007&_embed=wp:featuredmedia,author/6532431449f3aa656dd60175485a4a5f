Feedback from the blogosphere and comments were great; as of today there are almost 70 responses on the SitePen blog. Here&#8217;s a few snippets of coverage:\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-dojo-offline-toolkit/#comment-152\\\">Ed French</a>: &#8220;I like what you&#8217;re doing with this, good luck. With 2/3rds of PCs sold now being notebooks using webapps offline is clearly going to be important.&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-dojo-offline-toolkit/#comment-159\\\">Jadon:</a> &#8220;Awesome!

I&#8217;ve been seriously wanting this.&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.actkid.com/\\\">Chris Barber</a>: &#8220;This is really awesome news! It&#8217;s the stuff like offline support that make Dojo the Javascript toolkit!

I will explore some potential products to develop based on this platform. &#8220;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-dojo-offline-toolkit/#comment-197\\\">Andy Dean</a>: &#8220;Wonderful project.

Finally!&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/000386\\\">Dan Moore:</a> &#8220;&#8230;the Dojo Offline Toolkit promises to take things to a whole new level.&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://jeroencoumans.nl/\\\">Jeroen Coumans</a>: &#8220;It looks like 2007 will become the year in which we&#8217;ll get offline storage and offline functionality in web applications.&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www-03.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/etech?entry=introducing_dojo_offline_toolkit\\\">IBM developerWorks Blog</a>: &#8220;[The] Dojo Offline Toolkit has the potential to allow for disconnected use in a lot of common web applications, such as email, calendering, and more. To the users and developers out there, how would you use such a technology?&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us/url/ddf0eddcfadd73df7a9fbd2f4b11db94\\\">christmasgorilla</a>: &#8220;Competition for Adobe &#8212; and Open&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us/url/ddf0eddcfadd73df7a9fbd2f4b11db94\\\">cwinters</a>: &#8220;enable AJAX applications to work offline, using an OS-specific component; could be HUGE&#8221;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us/url/ddf0eddcfadd73df7a9fbd2f4b11db94\\\">dbt60626</a>: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be following this effort closely.

This is to ensure that the technology and API behind Dojo Offline are focused on the correct end-user&#8217;s needs. On paper we created Dojo Offline-enabled mockups of several web applications:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Gmail</li>\\n<li>Blogger</li>\\n<li>Google Docs</li>\\n<li>A Corporate Portal</li>\\n<li>Sales Application</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>The reason for several Google apps is I tried to modify apps that we actually use, and we use those three applications all day long.</li>\\n<li>We created a fake mockup on the computer of Gmail that has offline access using the Dojo Offline Toolkit. Some work still needs to be done on the mockup, but you can see a document with some of the UI possibilities here: <a href=\\\"http://codinginparadise.org/clients/sitepen/dojo_offline/SPOT_Mockups/overview.html\\\">http://codinginparadise.org/clients/sitepen/dojo_offline/SPOT_Mockups/overview.html</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>This Week</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The big goal this week is to finish the UI mockups and determine the API for Dojo Offline. For the Gmail mockup, I think I am going to add a Work Online/Work Offline to what is there. I also am going to create computer mockups of one more application, perhaps Blogger or the corporate portal example I have on paper. I might also work out a simple UI for resolving merge conflicts; if this gets too hairy I will back out quickly, since it might be out of scope for this release.</li>\\n<li>The other big goal is to determine an API for Dojo Offline.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We still need to figure out where in the Dojo Subversion repository this will live, since Polipo is currently under the GPL and we need to get a contributor license agreement from him.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Overview Every week we will be sending out a status report on the Dojo Offline Toolkit project to keep folks abreast of what SitePen has accomplished the last week and what is planned for the week ahead.
