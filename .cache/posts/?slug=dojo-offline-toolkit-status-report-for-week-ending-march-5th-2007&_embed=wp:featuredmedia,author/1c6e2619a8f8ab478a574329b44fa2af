This includes improving linkage between the JavaScript layer and the local proxy to make sure we work correctly when the network is present or gone; pulling and adding resources from the local proxy cache even without HTTP/1.1 headers sent from the server if we are offline; and more. We might also begin to create installers/uninstallers for Windows, as well as code to register the local web proxy for startup when the system starts.</p>\\n<p>Also, the Moxie demo has been used by scores of people, with lots of interesting sample documents added by folks, and someone found a way to upload some content that breaks when we download it through our JSON data structure (I believe it is a SCRIPT tag that is closed, but I am still isolating the bug). Until then the downloading phase of Dojo Offline for Moxie spins continuously; this is a Moxie bug and not a Dojo Offline bug, which I will isolate this week and fix.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Sorry about getting this up a little late in the day; I&#8217;m actually in Redmond, Washington right now to attend a Microsoft research event at their R&amp;D labs.
