Akin to listening to the whole album, we got a sense of how the frameworks pull it all together. In this post, we explore what are common types of applications and how the frameworks we are considering might work in those use cases. If you are going to throw a party, you want to know if your favorite band is going to set the right mood.</p>\\n<p><!--more--></p>\\n<p>In this post, we are looking at the aspects of mobile applications, content management or portals, consumer-facing applications, and business applications. We will discuss the common needs of each of these and then how the compared frameworks meet those needs.</p>\\n<p>This is part of a series on web frameworks. If you&#8217;ve missed our previous posts, you may want to start with <a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2017/06/13/if-we-chose-our-javascript-framework-like-we-chose-our-music/\\\">If we chose our JavaScript framework like we choose our music&#8230;</a></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"mobile\\\">Mobile</h2>\\n<p><em>Mobile first</em> is a buzzword that entered the common lexicon of applications, not only web applications. Like many other buzzwords, it oversimplifies several things, but it does make it easy for people to use the term. For web applications, this largely falls into three main concepts.</p>\\n<p>We have the <em>hybrid</em> or <em>embedded</em> application, where the application&#8217;s outer <em>shell</em> is a native container. Enhanced native integration is accomplished via <a href=\\\"https://cordova.apache.org/\\\">Apache Cordova</a> (or derivative distributions like <a href=\\\"https://phonegap.com/\\\">Adobe PhoneGap</a>) which allows you to write all or parts of your native application using web technologies to create an application.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"pull-right\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mobile-image.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14929\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<p>The second major concept is the <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/\\\">Progressive Web Application</a> which was a concept originally coined by Google but has been largely adopted by the community. At its heart, PWAs are a set of best practices, fully leveraging some of the more modern standards available in web browsers on smart devices. These standards help ensure that users can experience a web application in a way is performant in constrained environments, provide functionality when not online, and deliver the benefits of an <em>installed</em> native application. PWA supports progressive enhancement over time.</p>\\n<p>Finally, there is the concept of Server Side Rendering (SSR). This allows an application to be instantiated server-side, and certain aspects are calculated before the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are sent to the client device. In situations where there are constrained resources, like bandwidth or CPU speed, having this work <em>offloaded</em> to the server can help an application be more responsive to the user, where the user gets visible information from the application early, while the rest of the application is loading in the background.</p>\\n<p>Part of the reason why we are dissecting these different use cases is that many times, concepts can be over-hyped and are not really germane to the problems that you are trying to solve. One of those concepts that could be considered over-hyped is the concept of a <em>responsive</em> application, one that <em>scales</em> from a mobile device to a desktop application, adapting the UX to meet the constraints of those different platforms. Mobile, tablet, and desktop user experiences are quite different. Pushing all the code to manage that in a web application often makes the application larger and more complex than an application that is built specifically for a platform. Users will not be using the same application from their mobile phone and running it on their desktop, and the client application environment can be determined at load time. Having the wrong approach to responsive applications can easily sacrifice the user experience for the sake of developer ease.</p>\\n<p>Because of this risk, we should be cautious about how we build our applications. Are we using the right tools and right approaches for the problems we are trying to solve? This is why, in part, we are presenting four major use cases. What the user experience on mobile is can be very distinct to what an experience would be on a desktop business application and may require different approaches, or even different tools.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"consumer-applications\\\">Consumer applications</h2>\\n<p>We would define consumer applications as a step above content management systems or portals. You may be developing a solution, like a banking website, or the latest social media craze to topple Facebook, or something more revolutionary. We consider these applications to be a situation where you have a single authenticated user who is interacting with processes that are heavily tailored to that user, but the business process is fairly well known and straightforward, where the consumer is led down a generally linear path.</p>\\n<p>These applications tend to focus on processes that are easy to self-discover for the user, with little or no training on what they are performing. They are highly suitable for rapid evolutionary changes, since a user might only perform the process a few times a year, and the process is fairly straightforward and linear.</p>\\n<p>In order to achieve these consumer application goals, there are some typical patterns that frameworks can offer to make this easy:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Single Page Applications (SPA)</strong>: the user would be able to utilize the application without sensing that there is a full page reload between interactions, though the URL in the browser may be updated to reflect a particular <em>location</em> within the application.</li>\\n<li><strong>Authenticating users</strong>: a common use case and while it might be heavily dependent on the back-end systems, many consumer-facing applications need to leverage some of the open authentication platforms, like <a href=\\\"https://oauth.net/\\\">OAuth</a>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Accepting user input and validating it, before it is sent to a back-end service, a common feature of most consumer applications. Providing an easy mechanism to describe this validation can help simply application creation.</li>\\n<li><strong>Server interaction</strong>: Less than a decade ago, everything about libraries was focused on AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML), which was the concept of sending requests, from the browser to a server to interact with a service or retrieve data. There are clearly many other technologies today, but this basic interaction is still fundamental to building most applications.</li>\\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: While accessibility (a11y) might not be a top concern of those making consumer applications, it should be. The web was founded on openness and allowing everyone to access your information. We should all strive to make our applications available to everyone.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"business-applications\\\">Business applications</h2>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/business-image.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1200\\\" height=\\\"630\\\" class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14933\\\" /></p>\\n<p>We consider business applications to be the heavy lifting of web applications, and the unsung heroes of the enterprise. Business applications typically present many various business processes and allow the expert user to interact in an open-ended or unstructured way with the business processes. These expert users have been trained on the business processes they perform or manage, and they often would require training on the systems with which they interact.</p>\\n<p>These web applications often have complex requirements, are maintained over longer periods of time, and tend to be very sensitive to changes. Something as simple as moving the location of a button can incense your users as you have affected their user journey to their annoyance. Changes have to be socialized extensively with the user community.</p>\\n<p>While exploring this type of applications, we will look for any <em>special sauce</em> in dealing with these more advanced needs. We will look at many of the features we covered in more detail back in the <a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2017/07/06/web-frameworksfoundational-technologies/\\\">Foundations</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2017/08/03/web-frameworks-applications/\\\">Applications</a> blog posts, but apply a lens of pragmatism. We will also look at two common functional features that you find in business applications, charts and grids, which are often used to interact with and display complex data.</p>\\n<p>In the following sections, we summarize features of which we use the following convention:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>✓ &#8211; Feature is present and reasonably usable.</li>\\n<li>✗ &#8211; Feature is not provided by the framework, though there may be third-party solutions that solve the problem.</li>\\n<li>❓ &#8211; Feature is partially present, or the framework could be capable of providing the feature, but there are some questions in our minds about the viability of the feature or how straightforward it is to make it function as expected.</li>\\n<li>? &#8211; Feature is on the framework&#8217;s roadmap (and we believe it will arrive and will not turn into Duke Nukem Forever).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Jump to:</h4>\\n<ul class=\\\"jump-to\\\">\\n<li><a href=\\\"#angular\\\"><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/angular-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" /></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#react\\\"><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/react-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" /></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#vue\\\"><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/vue-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" /></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#dojo\\\"><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dojo-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" /></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#ember\\\"><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ember-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" /></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#aurelia\\\"><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/aurelia-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" /></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<div id=\\\"angular\\\" class=\\\"rule\\\"></div>\\n<div class=\\\"feature-icon\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14439\\\" src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/angular-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></div>\\n<h2 class=\\\"feature-item\\\">Angular 2+</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"mobile-1\\\">Mobile</h3>\\n<p>Out of the box, Angular 2+ does not offer any particular focus on mobile, though <a href=\\\"https://material.angularjs.org/latest/layout/options\\\">Material 2</a> will perform optimized layout on smaller screen devices, as well components that are designed to handle mobile input, like swipe gestures.</p>\\n<p>As mentioned in the previous blog post, Angular 2+ has a dedicated <a href=\\\"https://mobile.angular.io/\\\">mobile site</a> which gives inaccurate and outdated information on how to create mobile PWA-compliant mobile applications. While it seems possible to create compliant PWA applications with Angular 2+, the tooling does not effectively support it at this point with confusing and contradictory issues about how the team intends to resolve this.</p>\\n<p>Angular 2+ offers a solution for Server Side Rendering called <a href=\\\"https://universal.angular.io/\\\">Angular Universal</a> though this seems to suffer from the same challenge as PWAs, including the quick start guide on the website not working with current versions of Angular. There are several open issues that appear to indicate that even basic setup currently feels problematic.</p>\\n<p>If your development is mobile-focused, and you like Angular 2+, then you would likely be better suited to utilize <a href=\\\"https://ionicframework.com/\\\">Ionic</a>, which is built on top of Angular 2+, offers out of the box Cordova support, and is entirely focused on mobile applications.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr class=\\\"header\\\">\\n<th>Feature</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Presence</th>\\n<th>Notes</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>PWA Support</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">❓</td>\\n<td>The out of the box experience is currently broken</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Server Side Rendering</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">❓</td>\\n<td>Requires significant effort to get this working</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>Mobile Components/UX</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>Assuming you use Material 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Cordova Support</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Ionic 2, built on Angular 2+ is a possibility</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3 id=\\\"consumer-applications-1\\\">Consumer applications</h3>\\n<p>Angular 2+, much like Angular 1 that preceded it, is focused on providing single page applications. It allows you to define routes that trigger the application to display a particular <em>view</em> or activate a particular <em>service</em>. This allows linking to parts of an application, and the whole system is designed around presenting an application that does not require a page re-load during the user experience.</p>\\n<p>Angular 2+ does not come with any out of the box authentication integrations, though there are several third-party tools that leverage the Angular 2+ router to hook into various standard authentication platforms including OAuth.</p>\\n<p>Angular 2+ provides <a href=\\\"https://angular.io/guide/form-validation\\\">explicit guidelines for validating user input</a>, generally focused on how to author <em>templates</em> and wire together validation logic.</p>\\n<p>Angular 2+ provides an <a href=\\\"https://angular.io/guide/http\\\">HttpClient module</a> that builds on top of XMLHttpRequest to make it easier to interact with servers and remote services.</p>\\n<p>As we discussed in the User Interface post, Angular 2+ does not inhibit accessibility, but the standard package does not really promote it either. Material 2 provides components that by themselves are accessible and does give some guidance on how to make whole applications that are accessible.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr class=\\\"header\\\">\\n<th>Feature</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Presence</th>\\n<th>Notes</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>Single Page Application/Routing</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>The first router release with Angular 2 has been deprecated and replaced with a new router.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Authentication</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>There are several proven third-party integrations.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>Data Validation</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>An explicit pattern for providing these features.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Server Interaction</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>A decent abstraction to interact with back-end services.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>a11y</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>If you use Material 2, other UI frameworks built on Angular 2 would need to be vetted.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3 id=\\\"business-applications-1\\\">Business applications</h3>\\n<p>Angular 2+ provides internationalization (i18n) and a level of localization (l10n) as part of the base framework and provides <a href=\\\"https://angular.io/guide/i18n\\\">reasonable guidance</a> on how to leverage the feature.</p>\\n<p>As far as data handling, there are no tools that are part of the official Angular project, though there are various third-party solutions to provide data abstraction and integration.

Specifically, when it comes to PWA, there is no direct support, though you would not directly expect such direct support from React or Redux.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to Server Side Rendering, <a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html\\\">Redux</a> specifically addresses the considerations that are required for being able to set up an application <em>instance</em> on the server and extract the sort of information needed to bootstrap an application.</p>\\n<p>There is no official support for Cordova from React and Redux, though there are many tutorials and boilerplate applications available from third-parties and there are no barriers to being able to build applications in Cordova with React + Redux.</p>\\n<p>It is worth mentioning <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\\\">React Native</a>, which allows you to build native applications using JavaScript. This does not allow you to create <em>hybrid</em> or a <em>mobile web application</em> but instead create a native iOS or Android application that is indistinguishable from one built with Object C, Swift, or Java.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr class=\\\"header\\\">\\n<th>Feature</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Presence</th>\\n<th>Notes</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>PWA Support</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>There are many guides available on how to achieve this.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Server Side Rendering</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>There is official information on how to accomplish this.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>Mobile Components/UX</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>While you can really build <em>any</em> type of components with React, we consider React Native, using the native controls of mobile devices, as one type of <em>full</em> solution for a mobile UX.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Cordova Support</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Though there are no barriers to supporting Cordova.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3 id=\\\"consumer-applications-2\\\">Consumer applications</h3>\\n<p>When it comes to single page applications and routing with React, it gets a little complicated. Being fairly simplistic and straightforward libraries, with a community that builds many interesting things with React + Redux, there is significant innovation. One of those is a third-party <a href=\\\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/\\\">React Router</a> which has become the <em>de facto</em> router for React applications. However, keeping state for the router, it needed to be bound to the state store of Redux, which led to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux\\\">react-router-redux</a> being managed by the React team and therefore being <em>official</em>. This was then moved into a package that is part of React Router, making it not quite official? Of course, as is common in the React ecosystem, if you are not happy with these solutions, there are plenty of other variations available.</p>\\n<p>This is the biggest challenge when it comes to React + Redux, there are so many patterns, tools, conventions, and approaches, that unless you lay down your standards early in the development process, your team will develop something that only a few people will understand and be able to maintain. Even projects developed with the same technologies might struggle to be compatible and consistent. You also need to be confident that the engineers setting the conventions and standards <em>know</em> what they are doing.</p>\\n<p>As you might expect, when it comes to authentication, there is no official (or pseudo-official) solution to this use case, though there are many third-party examples and solutions for various authentication platforms.</p>\\n<p>Redux&#8217;s simplistic approach to managing state with actions are called reducers, which mutate state, which then provides data to components, making the task of validating user input easy, even though there are no out of the box higher order validation schemes. This leaves the decision about how validation works up to each developer. There are third-party higher order frameworks for providing <em>form</em> or <em>input</em> type validation or keeping back-end data consistent with application state.</p>\\n<p>React + Redux by themselves do not offer server interaction APIs. They expect that developers will either leverage an abstraction and wire it into the application state, or just leverage the native browser APIs. The same goes for accessibility. The expectation is that a developer would leverage knowledge of a11y to ensure that components and applications are accessible, or that teams would leverage libraries of components that are already created to be accessible.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr class=\\\"header\\\">\\n<th>Feature</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Presence</th>\\n<th>Notes</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>Single Page Application/Routing</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>There are many options and choices.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Authentication</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Nothing extra out of the box, but many references and examples.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>Data Validation</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>With a one way flow of data, validating data becomes a straightforward pattern.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Server Interaction</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Expected to bring your own abstraction or native APIs.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>a11y</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Expected to build your own components or leverage a component library.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3 id=\\\"business-applications-2\\\">Business applications</h3>\\n<p>As mentioned in the foundations post, React + Redux don&#8217;t provide out of the box support for i18n/l10n, though there are some popular third-party solutions.</p>\\n<p>For charting, again, there is nothing out of the box, though there are dedicated third-party projects that wrap other charting libraries as React components. Notable are Uber&#8217;s <a href=\\\"https://uber.github.io/react-vis/#/\\\">react-vis</a>, <a href=\\\"http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/\\\">Victory</a> and the pseudo-official <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-chartjs\\\">react-chartjs</a> which provides <a href=\\\"http://www.chartjs.org/\\\">chart.js</a> charts as React components. </p>\\n<p>For data grids, there is nothing provided out of the box. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, there are various third-party solutions, of which it is difficult to assess how effective they would be in dealing with large datasets.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to data handling, there is the Facebook-related project called <a href=\\\"http://graphql.org/\\\">GraphQL</a>. While it is not specific to React + Redux, and can be integrated with many other projects, it is a solution to data handling that fits very well with a React + Redux solution. In addition, it solves one of the biggest challenges of client-side development, especially in a micro-services architecture, in that back-end services are seldom written with the needs of a front-end in mind. GraphQL allows a client application to easily describe the <em>shape</em> and <em>structure</em> of the data it needs and where to get it from, and a GraphQL server will orchestrate retrieving that data and shaping in the way to be efficiently consumed by the front-end application. For those willing to introduce this middle tier, GraphQL can be a hugely powerful tool to accelerate front-end development.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr class=\\\"header\\\">\\n<th>Feature</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Presence</th>\\n<th>Notes</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>i18n/l10n</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Expected to bring your own solution.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Data Handling</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✓</td>\\n<td>Giving credit to React + Redux for GraphQL, but it can be used with many other frameworks.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>Charting</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Again, bring your own, but there appear to be solid third-party solutions.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Grid</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">✗</td>\\n<td>Bring your own, but not as robust of a community of solutions as charts.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<div id=\\\"vue\\\" class=\\\"rule\\\"></div>\\n<div class=\\\"feature-icon\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14439\\\" src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/vue-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></div>\\n<h2 class=\\\"feature-item\\\">Vue.js</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"mobile-3\\\">Mobile</h3>\\n<p>Vue.js has an official <a href=\\\"https://github.com/vuejs-templates/pwa\\\">PWA template</a> that is being maintained, also with additional information on how to leverage the template.</p>\\n<p>For SSR, Vue.js has a <a href=\\\"https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/\\\">site dedicated to server-side rendering</a>.
