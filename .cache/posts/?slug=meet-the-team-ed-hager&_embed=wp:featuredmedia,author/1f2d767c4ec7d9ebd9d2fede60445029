How&#8217;s it going? Let&#8217;s start our interview with where you&#8217;re living currently?</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\"> Thanks, Carrie. Sure. I live in Poulsbo, Washington, a ferry ride west of downtown Seattle.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">I <img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HeartEmoji.png\\\" class=\\\"emoji\\\"> Seattle! (Note to reader: I live on the side of Seattle that doesn&#8217;t require a ferry ride) I&#8217;ve already shared a bit about you so, in your own words, why don&#8217;t you tell us what you&#8217;re usually up to when you&#8217;re not being truly amazing at SitePen?</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">    I am not a usual kind of person so it can really vary.  Right now, I am enjoying disc golf and making hard apple cider.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">Cool and Yum! Stockpiling alcohol is definitely smart given the impending Zombie Apocalypse.  Now that we have hydration covered, what would be your weapon of choice: Samurai Sword or Crossbow?</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">  Sword, shotgun and a monster truck.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\"> Smart, very smart. My next question is about working remotely. To avoid any confusion, I&#8217;m not asking what it&#8217;s like to work so far from civilization (like Poulsbo), I mean what do you like most about not having to go into an office every day to put in time at &#8220;work&#8221;? </p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">Ha&#8230;.ha. Poulsbo is really close to Seattle and still has a lot of small businesses and restaurants &#8212; not aimed at tourists.  On working<em> remotely</em>, my answer is less commute time, more family time.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\"> Just so everyone knows, Ed used to live on Bainbridge Island which is completely devoted to tourism. ðŸ™‚ Next up: name something on your bucket list!</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">    Kiteboarding, learning to weld and blacksmith.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\"> Blacksmithing! That&#8217;s a really unusual answer.  I like it!  If asked in highschool where you&#8217;d be in 15 years, how would your friends have responded?</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">    Personal computers were just becoming a thing when I was in high school (class of â€™85) so if you waited until my senior year, I think they would have said computer programmer.  Definitely something math and science related.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">Speaking of your senior year in highschool, I&#8217;m just going to leave this picture of you with a perm right here: <img src=\\\"//wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ed_perm.jpg\\\"> </p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">Great. <img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/emojiTongue.png\\\" class=\\\"emojiLarge\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">What is the one thing you want to share with the complete stranger reading this right now?</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">Take real vacations.  Visiting family doesnâ€™t count.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">Very wise and I would have to agree.  What&#8217;s another fun fact about You?</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">From 1999 until about 2009, I did a lot of backcountry snowboarding in British Columbia, Canada.  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\"> More extreme sports!  If only we had time for all of your amazing tales! I&#8217;ve seen some of the pics and they are amazing! Moving on to my next question, what does your hardware set up look like??</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">I went from earning a paycheck on DEC VAXes to Windows to Linux all while having an Apple computer at home.  My first was an Apple IIe.  Today, my primary machine is a MacBook Pro.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\"> Ugh! I was <em>trying</em> to portray you as this super cool, young, hip dude&#8230;but this, along with the highschool class year you blurted out &#8212; that I TRIED to gloss over &#8212; my attempts have been futile&#8230; ðŸ˜‰  Last question: what&#8217;s your favorite feature of IE?</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">It is a tie between the ability to download the Google Chrome installer and Alt &#8211; F &#8211; Exit.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble me\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\"> HA! Well, Ed, it has been my pleasure chatting with you and I&#8217;m sure everyone is as impressed as I am with your human being-ness.  I&#8217;m gonna let you get back to being awesome. See ya!</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"bubble you\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"chatMessage\\\">Thanks.  Later!</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\\\"chatNotice\\\">movin-man has left #interview_room</p>\\n<p>If you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for more info on Ed, just ask! Ed is a fun, kind-hearted soul and always willing to chat!
