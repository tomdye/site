Also, when choosing a web framework, you are to some degree, choosing to participate in a community of developers and fellow users. How this community works and behaves can also have an impact on you and your team&#8217;s ability to build the web applications you want to build.</p>\\n<p>This is part of a series on web frameworks.

The resources page has an <a href=\\\"https://angular.io/resources#education\\\">Education</a> section which provides links to books, workshops, on-site training and online training. There are also links to community groups and podcasts listed.</p>\\n<p>As is to be expected with a popular framework, there is a wide spectrum of community and commercial organizations involved in the Angular 2+ training.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"support\\\">Support</h3>\\n<p>The Angular 2+ team directs their users to <a href=\\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular\\\">StackOverflow</a> and <a href=\\\"https://gitter.im/angular/angular\\\">Gitter</a> for support. Regressions, bug reports, feature requests or documentation issues are managed on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues\\\">GitHub</a>.</p>\\n<p>There are several commercial support options, including SitePen&#8217;s <a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/services/index\\\">on-demand development and support</a>.</p>\\n<div id=\\\"react\\\" class=\\\"rule\\\"></div>\\n<div class=\\\"feature-icon\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14439\\\" src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/react-logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></div>\\n<h2 class=\\\"feature-item\\\">React + Redux</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"community-overview-1\\\">Community overview</h3>\\n<p>React and Redux are highly popular, which has led to a large community. For React, there is a specific <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/community/support.html\\\">Community</a> page which provides information on support and participating in the community, conferences, and video highlights. It also links to complementary tools and examples. The React project is part of the Facebook Open Source, an initiative at Facebook to make their tools and technologies open to the world. Redux is maintained by the reactjs GitHub organization. <a href=\\\"https://reactcommunity.org/\\\">The organization</a> is designed to ensure that open source projects that are important to the React community have a long-term home to provide support and maintenance.</p>\\n<p>React v16.0+ is licensed under the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE\\\">MIT License</a>. The copyright is held by Facebook, Inc. Versions from 0.12.0 to prior to v16.0 were released as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dcf415c2b91ce52fd5d4dd02b70875ba9d33290f/LICENSE\\\">BSD-3 Clause patents</a>. Again, we are not lawyers, but the <em>plus patents</em> caused a lot of controversy in the React community, with many commercial organizations stopping the use of React based on legal advice that the <em>plus patents</em> was a legal risk to the using organization. This led Facebook to reconsider its position on the license and to relicense the library under the MIT License. Prior to 0.12.0, React was licensed under the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/15493530f13619ec1786aa87be585013c1f0b57c/LICENSE\\\">Apache License 2.0</a>.</p>\\n<p>Redux is licensed under the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/LICENSE.md\\\">MIT License</a>.

React and Redux do not belong to an independent open source software foundation, something that we feel would have helped with the recent challenges around the licensing controversy.</p>\\n<p>As discussed several times in this series, React + Redux are likely not an entire set of libraries that would be used to build a web application. This means that each package will have its own license and copyright concerns.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"learning-and-education-1\\\">Learning and education</h3>\\n<p>The React <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/\\\">Docs page</a> provides a fairly extensive set of basic and advanced information on React.

Vue.js and Aurelia are currently heavily reliant upon sole individuals who developed and maintain the frameworks.  Only Dojo 2 is currently part of an open source foundation.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr class=\\\"header\\\">\\n<th>Feature</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Angular 2+</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">React + Redux</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Vue.js</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Dojo 2</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Ember.js</th>\\n<th align=\\\"center\\\">Aurelia</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>License</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">MIT</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">MIT or BSD (3-clause with patents)</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">MIT</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">New BSD (2-clause)</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">MIT</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">MIT</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Copyright</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">Google</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">Facebook / Dan Abramov</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">Evan You</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">JS Foundation</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">Yehuda Katz, Tom Dale, and Ember.js contributors</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">Blue Spire Inc.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td>OSS Foundation</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ—</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ—</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ—</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ“</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ—</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ—</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\\\"even\\\">\\n<td>Support</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ“</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ“</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ“</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ“</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ“</td>\\n<td align=\\\"center\\\">âœ“</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3 id=\\\"angular-2-1\\\">Angular 2+</h3>\\n<p>Angular 2+ has a large community, driven by its popularity. While the community is led primarily by Google, there are many other organizations and individuals involved in the community. Of the top 5 contributors to Angular, only two currently work for Google. There are many choices around learning materials as well as ways of getting support.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"react-redux-1\\\">React + Redux</h3>\\n<p>React + Redux has a large community, driven by its popularity. For React, the top 5 contributors currently work at Facebook. Redux was developed by Dan Abramov before joining Facebook and the second top contributor does not work at Facebook. There are many choices around learning materials as well as ways of getting support.</p>\\n<p>One of the biggest challenges is that the two libraries together do not provide a complete solution. Looking at the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Complementary-Tools\\\">complementary tools</a> for React will highlight just what a large ecosystem it is and how many choices a team or developer needs to make, all with varying degrees quality and options around support.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"vue.js-1\\\">Vue.js</h3>\\n<p>Vue.js has an active and thriving community with the effort spread across many organizations and companies.  It may be worth considering though the risk of it having essentially a single committer in Evan You. There is no shortage of resources and community help for learning and using Vue.js, and commercial training and support options are available as well.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"dojo-2-1\\\">Dojo 2</h3>\\n<p>Dojo 2 is a new project and does not yet have a large community, though Dojo 1 had a large community at various times.  There is a fairly wide diversity of contributions across packages for Dojo 2, though the vast majority of the code for Dojo 2 comes from current or former employees of SitePen. The Dojo 2 team is working to provide a solid foundation for community support for the Dojo 2 release. Commercial support options are available directly from the active contributors to Dojo 2.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"ember.js-1\\\">Ember.js</h3>\\n<p>Ember has a solid and stable community and a solid history of providing a supportive community.  Ember has a huge diversity of contributors, with the top 5 contributors either working for LinkedIn or Tilde. Ember provides extensive documentation, resources, and support channels, with various training and support options available.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"aurelia-1\\\">Aurelia</h3>\\n<p>Aurelia has a smaller but loyal and active community.  Over 90% of the main packages are authored by Rob Eisenberg, so again it may be worth considering the risk of depending on a single individual. Official training and support options are available from both the community and commercial options are also available.</p>\\n<h2>Up Next</h2>\\n<p>In the next and final track of the series,
