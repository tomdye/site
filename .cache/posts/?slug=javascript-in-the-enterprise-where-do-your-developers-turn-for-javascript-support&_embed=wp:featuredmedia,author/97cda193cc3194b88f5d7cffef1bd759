A developer has hit a roadblock while trying to integrate code from another team and connect it to a third-party API.  He can’t figure out where things are going wrong.  Is it his code? Is it the other team’s code? Is it the API? A few hours in and he&#8217;s going in circles &#8212; with no answer in sight.</p>\\n<h2>&#8216;Who can I even ask to help me with this?&#8217;</h2>\\n<p>The rest of the developers on the team are heads down trying to complete their own tasks, and googling for an answer has proven fruitless due to the number of moving parts involved.</p>\\n<p>After pinging a couple of the developers on the other team and getting the runaround, the developer is completely stuck.

The developer did the best he could with what he had to work with. But what if there was an&#8230;</p>\\n<h4>Option 3: SitePen Support</h4>\\n<p>The developer logs into his SitePen Support account, provides the details of his issue and asks for an answer.
