Such power is not without potential for abuse.  Imagine a Starbucks locater that would fire off an alert anytime a phone got with in 100 yards of a Starbucks. A <a href=\\\"http://www.sqlite.org/\\\">SQLite</a> database would hold store locations and XMPP messages would keep the application aware of newly opened stores.  Anyone traveling through a major city with such an application would be inundated with an unending stream of beeps and or vibrations.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://wp.sitepen.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/android_gears.png\\\" alt=\\\"android_gears.png\\\" style=\\\"float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;\\\" />Building apps using the Open Web with the Android browser looks to be comparable to the Safari version shipping with today&#8217;s iPhone. Unfortunately, Google Gears does not appear to be part of the WebKit browser included in the first release of the SDK. Accessing the Gears demo prompts users to install it. The install page results in the error pictured here. </p>\\n<p>Native Gears support in the browser would be a huge advantage to web developers targeting Android phones.  Big challenges to mobile web application development are low network speeds and intermittent network connectivity.  Google Gears and <a href=\\\"https://www.sitepen.com/offline.php\\\">Dojo Offline</a> go a long way towards solving both problems&#8211;especially if users are automatically taken on and offline as needed.</p>\\n<p>Overall, the Android SDK is very impressive and much more than a press release.  Steve Ballmer may just have to <a href=\\\"http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1807448826\\\">eat his words</a> yet <a href=\\\"http://valleywag.com/tech/steve-ballmer/microsoft-ceo-chokes-on-an-iphone-229806.php\\\">again</a>.
