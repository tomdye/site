A nice side-effect is the API will actually work without having us to finish the local proxy immediately, since it can just cache it&#8217;s UI files using standard HTTP/1.1 caching inside the browser cache. This means folks can get started prototyping apps quickly; the downside is that your UI files might get blown from the browser cache, which is what the small, downloadable web proxy is meant to solve.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Overview Every week we will be sending out a status report on the Dojo Offline Toolkit project to keep folks abreast of what we have accomplished the last week and what is planned for the week ahead.
